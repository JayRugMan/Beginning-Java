# Review of Inheritance and Polymorphism

Excellent work! You’ve learned quite a bundle about inheritance and polymorphism in Java:

- A Java class can inherit fields and methods[^1] from another class.
- Each Java class requires its own file, but only one class in a Java package needs a `main()` method.
- Child classes[^2] inherit the parent constructor by default, but it’s possible to modify the constructor using `super()` or override it completely.
- You can use `protected` and `final` to control child class access to parent class members.
- Java’s OOP principle of polymorphism means you can use a child class object like a member of its parent class, but also give it its own traits.
- You can override parent class methods in the child class, ideally using the `@Override` keyword.
- It’s possible to use objects of different classes that share a parent class together in an array or `ArrayList`.

[^1]: [Methods](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/methods) are reusable pieces of code in classes. The difference between a method and a function is that methods are always related to a class or an object.  
[^2]: A [class](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/classes) is a blueprint or template for an object in Java
